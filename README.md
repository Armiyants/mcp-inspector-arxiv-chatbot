# MCP Inspector Arxiv Chatbot üìö

Hello, people jan! ü§ó
Let's now build our MCP server, run locally and test our tools with a friendly UI from the MCP Inspector.
Hope my comments along the code will be helpful. 

To do it locally on your own: 

### 1. Clone & Install

First, make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Armiyants/mcp-inspector-arxiv-chatbot.git
cd mcp_inspector_arxiv_chatbot
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the MCP Server

Start the server locally:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python mcp_server.py
```

Follow the link and open the MCP Inspector UI in your browser.
